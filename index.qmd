title: "Introduction to R"
---

R is an open-source programming language for statistical computing and graphics. R is extensible, and has a large collection of high-quality user contributed packages that provides easy tools for common data analysis tasks. This mini-course will introduce you the fundamentals of R programming with a focus on data management, data visualization and quantitative finance applications in R.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### What To Prepare

-   Please install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) before the first session.

    RStudio is the most popular IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for R. Most people use RStudio if they want to write some R code.

    If you encounter technical difficulties installing the software, you can instead create a free [RStudio Cloud](https://posit.cloud/) account so you can run R and RStudio in the cloud via your browser.

    An alternative to RStudio Cloud is the UofT JupyterHub/RStudio system. Go to its [home page](https://datatools.utoronto.ca/), choose the *RStudio* option, and click *Log in to start*. You will need your UTORid.

-   We will also use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), and I assume you all have a Google account.

    Google Colab lets you combine code and notes in a "notebook". It is a hosted Jupyter Notebook service that requires no setup to use. It is a convenient coding environment to get started with R programming.

    UofT JupyterHub offers a similar notebook setting. Go to its [home page](https://datatools.utoronto.ca/), choose the *Jupyter Notebook* or *JupyterLab* option, and click *Log in to start*. You will need your UTORid.
