R is extensible, and has a large collection of high-quality user contributed packages that provides easy tools for common data analysis tasks. This mini-course will introduce you the fundamentals of R programming with a focus on data management, data visualization and quantitative finance applications in R.\n\n\nWhat To Prepare\n\nPlease install R and RStudio Desktop before the first session.\nRStudio is the most popular IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for R. Most people use RStudio if they want to write some R code.\nIf you encounter technical difficulties installing the software, you can instead create a free RStudio Cloud account so you can run R and RStudio in the cloud via your browser.\nAn alternative to RStudio Cloud is the UofT JupyterHub/RStudio system. Go to its home page, choose the RStudio option, and click Log in to start. You will need your UTORid.\nWe will also use Google Colab, and I assume you all have a Google account.\nGoogle Colab lets you combine code and notes in a “notebook”. It is a hosted Jupyter Notebook service that requires no setup to use. It is a convenient coding environment to get started with R programming.\nUofT JupyterHub offers a similar notebook setting. Go to its home page, choose the Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab option, and click Log in to start. You will need your UTORid.\n\n\n\n\nPart 1 (Overview & Basics)\n\nSlides (coming soon)\nMotivation Examples\n\nAnalyze portfolio performance (R Script: performance_analysis.R)\nPerform earnings call sentiment analysis (sentiment dictionary vs “small” language model vs LLM)\n\nR script: earnings_call_v2.R\nMicrosoft Q2 2025 earnings call Word Cloud\n\nMake web API calls to get crypto prices\n\nR script: api_coingecko.R\nBitcoin price and volumn chart\n\nRecognize handwritten digits, a deep learning “Hello World” example\n\nR script 1 (using R Interface to Keras and Tensorflow for R): dl_hello_world_v2.R\nR script 2 (using Torch for R): dl_hello_world_torch.R\n\n\nBasic Data and Programming Structures\n\nData structures (R Notebook )\nProgramming structures (R Notebook )\n\nData Science Workflow - A Regression Example (Housing prices and clean air)\n\nLinear Regression - Base R (R Notebook )\nLinear Regression - Tidyverse & Others (R Notebook )\n\nData Import\nData Manipulation\nModelling\nReport (regression report example)\n\n\nAdditional materials on data and programming structures (from past workshops; optional)\n\nData structures\n\nVectors\nDerived data structures\n\nProgramming structures\n\nReading list\n\nR for Data Science (1e) (Chapter 1 Intro, 4 Workflow: basics, 5 Data transformation, 6 Workflow: scripts, 8 Workflow: projects, 10 Tibbles, 11 Data import, 18 Pipes, 19 Functions, 20 Vectors, and 21 Iteration.)\n\n\n\n\nPart 2 (Data Manipulation)\nComing Soon\n\n\nPart 3 (Visualization)\nComing Soon\n\n\nPart 4 (Tidymodels, Time Series and Some R Finance Packages)\nComing Soon\n\n\n\nResources\n\nFrom Zero to Hero\n\nStep 1: Hands-on Programming with R (start here if you never programmed before.)\nStep 2: R for Data Science (2e) (data science with R’s Tidyverse eco-system; 1st ed.)\nStep 3: Advanced R (master R)\n\nR Graphics\n\nR Graphics Cookbook\nggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis\nThe R Graph Gallery (R graph samples with code)\n\nR Econometrics & Finance\n\nTidy Finance with R\nIntroduction to Econometrics with R\nForecasting: Principles and Practice (2nd ed.; 3rd ed.)\nPortfolio Optimization (R & Python code available)\nFinancial Engineering Analytics: A Practice Manual Using R\nFinancial Risk Modelling and Portfolio Optimization with R (free access via UofT library)\nStatistics and Data Analysis for Financial Engineering with R examples (book download; book site)\n\nR Machine Learning\n\nAn Introduction to Statistical Learning / with Applications in R (R & Python code available)\nR Interface to Keras (deep learning with R)\nTensorflow for R (deep learning with R)\nTorch for R (deep learning with R)\n\nOthers\n\nA Short R Tutorial by Germán Rodríguez\nIntroductory Econometrics Examples (data and examples from Wooldridge)\nSTAT545 by Jenny Bryan : Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R\nProgramming with R (from software carpentry)\nR Cheat Sheets (cheat sheets for many popular R packages)\nMany more R books here\n\n\n\nBack to TDMDAL Computing Page"
